Frequently Asked Questions

## **How do I know if the translations are accurate?**

The latest AI models which are used by Lex Sensei are generally very good at producing accurate translations. To be extra safe, all of our pre-made content, including vocabulary lists/flashcards, storybooks, and initial conversation messages is manually reviewed by native speakers to ensure that it is as natural-sounding as possible.

## **How do you translate using different variations of a word/phrase?**

You can specify directly in the translation text if you want a particular variation of the word or phrase. For example, if you want an informal version of "Hello", you can type "Hello (informal)" and the translation should be "안뇽".
