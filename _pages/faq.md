Frequently Asked Questions
<br>

## **What if I'm stuck during a conversation?**

**You can ask Hendrix for a translation**: just tap Hendrix while he isn't talking or thinking, which should open a text bubble to his right, then type what you want him to translate, and he will give you the translation as well as the Korean pronunciation. Note that this will also automatically generate a flashcard for whatever text (and translation) you translate.
<br>
Alternatively, you can also **switch to the vocab list tab (the middle tab)** and see if anything matches what you're trying to say (these come pre-populated with many relevant words and phrases, so often times what you want will be there!). You can even switch to this tab while you're recording your audio, which lets you read what you're trying to say as you say it.

## **How do you translate using different variations of a word/phrase?**

You can specify directly in the translation text if you want a particular variation of the word or phrase. For example, if you want an informal version of "Hello", you can type "Hello (informal)" and the translation should be "안뇽".

## **What if I can't find content for what I want to practice?**

If you feel anything is missing (in terms of content, features, etc.) or have any other feedback, you can always reach out via email at **hi@hellohendrix.app**! The "Contact the Developer" button in the Account tab is a shortcut for this.
