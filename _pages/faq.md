## **How do you translate English into Korean?**

Just tap Hendrix while he isn't talking or thinking and type what you want him to translate.

## **How do you translate using different variations of a word/phrase?**

You can specify directly in the translation text if you want a particular variation of the word or phrase. For example, if you want an informal version of "Hello", you can type "Hello (informal)" and the translation should be "안뇽".
