# Terms and Conditions of Service

## General

Talkling mobile application ("App") and related services (collectively referred to as the “Service”) are operated by Talkling ("Talkling," "us," or "we"). By accessing or using any part of the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service (“Terms”). If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the Service. We may update these Terms from time to time, and if we make significant changes, we will notify you by posting a notice on our App. Changes will be effective after a 7-day notice period or the next time you access or use the Service after such changes, whichever comes first.

**PLEASE NOTE: THESE TERMS CONTAIN A MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION THAT REQUIRES DISPUTES TO BE RESOLVED THROUGH ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, RATHER THAN IN COURT OR THROUGH CLASS ACTIONS.**

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall Talkling, its affiliates, licensors, or service providers, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your use or inability to use the Service; (ii) any unauthorized access to or use of our servers and/or any personal information stored therein; (iii) any interruption or cessation of transmission to or from the Service; and (iv) any bugs, viruses, trojan horses, or the like that may be transmitted to or through the Service by any third party.

## Governing Law

These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws and regulations of the United States and any other relevant jurisdiction, without regard to its conflict of law principles. You agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in the United States to resolve any dispute or claim arising from these Terms.
