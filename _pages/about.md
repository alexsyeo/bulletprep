# About

![Image Alt Text](../assets/me.jpg)

Hello, my name is Alex and I'm the developer behind Hello Hendrix. Thank you for checking out the app! Below you can find more info on the app's origins and mission, as well as how you can get involved in improving it.

## Origin Story

During my travels in Asia, I observed that, despite being proficient in reading and writing, many language learners struggle to engage in everyday conversations. This is a challenge I have personally experienced growing up, as a Korean-American who has struggled with having conversations in Korean despite having attended Korean language school (한글학교). While traveling, I was also exploring trends in AI technology. After tinkering with the latest tools, I realized that, if used in the right way, they were good enough to effectively address the above issue. These realizations inspired me to create Hello Hendrix.

## Mission

Hello Hendrix's mission is to bridge the gap between traditional language learning and conversational fluency. Existing langauge learning apps often fall short in this area, leaving learners with a gap in their ability to communicate naturally. Hello Hendrix was born out of the need for a solution that goes beyond rote memorization and grammar drills, focusing instead on practical, real-life conversations.

Leveraging cutting-edge AI, Hello Hendrix provides a seamless and interactive experience to help you improve your Korean speaking skills in real-life scenarios. Whether you’re a beginner or looking to refine your conversational abilities, the app is designed to meet you where you are and take you to the next level.
